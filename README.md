SideQuest

SideQuest hopes to create road tripping, making planning and the actual process of road tripping easier. We hope to accomplish this by making a customizable mapping service that allows the user to choose their own custom route. This will benefit users in being able to choose what roads they take, how long theyâ€™re on the road, and how overall enjoyable their driving experience is.
